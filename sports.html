                        Kabaddi is a popular contact sport. It involves two teams, each trying to score points by sending a "raider" into the opponent's half to tag or wrestle with members of the opposing team before returning to their own half. The challenge for the raider is to do this while holding their breath and continuously chanting the word "kabaddi." If the raider is caught and unable to return, they are out. The defending team scores by stopping the raider.
